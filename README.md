# 📊 Project Donors: Nonprofit Data Collection

Simple tool to collect and analyze donor-advised funds, private foundations, and grants data from public sources for grant research.

## 🎯 What It Does

• **Collects** donor-advised funds and private foundation data from ProPublica API
• **Generates** research resources and prioritized foundation lists  
• **Analyzes** data with geographic and financial insights
• **Exports** targeted datasets for grant seeking

## 📁 Files

```
project-donors/
├── data_collector.py     # Main collection script
├── analyze_data.ipynb    # Analysis notebook
└── data/                 # Generated data files
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone or download the project
cd project-donors

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run Data Collection

```bash
# Basic organizational data collection
python data_collector.py

# Include comprehensive grants research tools
python data_collector.py --include-grants

# Skip the research guide output
python data_collector.py --skip-guide
```

### Analyze Data

```bash
# Open Jupyter notebook for analysis
jupyter notebook analyze_data.ipynb
```

### Upload CSVs to Postgres

Environment variables (copy `.env.example` to `.env`):

- DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/dbname
  or set PGHOST, PGPORT, PGDATABASE, PGUSER, PGPASSWORD

Run the loader:

```bash
python upload_data.py
```
